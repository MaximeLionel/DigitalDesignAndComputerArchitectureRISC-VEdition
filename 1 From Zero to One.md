* Starting at the beginning with 1’s and 0’s and leading through to the design of a microprocessor.
* Hardware description languages (HDLs) are at the center of modern digital design practices.

# 1.1 THE GAME PLAN
# 1.2 THE ART OF MANAGING COMPLEXITY
* You will need to learn to manage complexity to understand how to build a microprocessor without getting mired in a morass of detail.

## 1.2.1 Abstraction
* The critical technique for managing complexity is **abstraction**: hiding details when they are not important.
