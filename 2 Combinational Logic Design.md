# 2.1 INTRODUCTION
* In digital electronics, a circuit is a network that processes discrete-valued (离散) variables.
* A circuit can be viewed as a black box with:

	* one or more discrete-valued **input** terminals.
	* one or more discrete-valued **output** terminals.
	* a functional specification - the **relationship** between inputs and outputs.
	* a timing specification - the **delay** between inputs changing and outputs responding.
* Circuits are composed of **nodes** and **elements**. 
	* An element is itself a circuit with inputs, outputs, and a specification. 
	* A node is a wire, whose voltage conveys a discrete-valued variable.
